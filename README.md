## Introduction
*Perception is strong and sight weak. In strategy it is important to see distant things as if they were close and to take a distanced view of close things.*
â€• Miyamoto Musashi

Like any son leaving in a different country from their parents, I have spent quite some time comparing with my Mum the developments of SARS-COVID-19 pandemic in our respective countries.
Like any other person the is not an epidemiologist, it has taken me some time to understand how to look at COVID data in a meaningful way
